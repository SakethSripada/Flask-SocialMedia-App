# Flask Social Media Automation Application
Built on Flask using SQLAlchemy for DB

Functionality: 
As of the last README update, 2/12/24, the user can upload images, log in with their Instagram credentials, and then either post immediately or schedule times at which they would like these images to be posted. Then at these times, the application will automatically upload these photos to their Instagram page. The app also connects to the OpenAI API, so that the user may type in a prompt, and then DALL-E creates an image off of the user-entered prompt, and it is uploaded to the user's Instagram page. The same functionality also exists with liking and commenting on posts. There is also email verification and forgot password and CSRF protection is used.
