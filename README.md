# Flask Social Media Automation Application
Built on Flask using SQLAlchemy for DB

Functionality: 
As of the last README update, 2/17/24, the user can upload images/enter text, log in with their Instagram or Twitter credentials, and then either post immediately or schedule times at which they would like these images or tweets to be posted. Then at these times, the application will automatically upload these photos/tweets to their Instagram/Twitter page. The app also connects to the OpenAI API, so that the user may type in a prompt. Then DALL-E creates an image off of the user-entered prompt, or a tweet is generated using GPT 3.5 Turbo, and it is uploaded to the user's Instagram/Twitter page. The same functionality also exists with liking and commenting on posts on Instagram. Currently on twitter, the user can schedule recurring tweets that AI generates. For example, a user can set an interval of 12 hours, and then enter a prompt for AI, let's say "News Headlines about Stock Market". Then, every 2 hours, GPT 3.5 Turbo will generate a new tweet based on that prompt, and upload it to their twitter profile. Working on extending this into Instagram. There is also email verification and forgot password and CSRF protection is used.
