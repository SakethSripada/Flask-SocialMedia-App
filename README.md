# Flask Social Media Automation Application
Built on Flask using SQLAlchemy for DB

Functionality: 
As of the last README update, 2/5/24, the user can upload images, login with their instagram credentials, and then either post immediately or schedule times at which they wouuld like these images to be posted. Then at these times, the application will automatically upload these photos to their instagram page. Same functionality also exists with liking and commenting on posts.


Future Plans:
Future plans for this project include adding more social medias to create a sort of social media hub where users can access all of their accounts and make posts, for 100% free. I plan on expanding this project and eventually adding AI image generation, and other cool features. 
FREE inventory management, and money management for businesses are some more long-term features I wish to add, and create this into a free platform for small or local businesses to operate on.
