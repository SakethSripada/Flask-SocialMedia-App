After getting this repository, ENSURE that you run the following commands for the Database to work:

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
flask db upgrade

IF YOU DO NOT RUN THESE COMMANDS, THE TABLE WILL NOT BE CREATED IN THE DB, AND THE APP WILL NOT WORK!

Any time you make a change to the database, RUN:
flask db migrate -m "Your change message"
flask db upgrade

TO RUN APP: flask run  - into the CLI

Or set up run configuration with FlaskServer, do not use python app.py, this does not work
